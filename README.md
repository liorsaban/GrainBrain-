## How to Use GrainBrain

### **Step 1: Enter Sample ID**

### **Step 2: Measure Empty Sieves**
- Place each empty sieve on the scale and press **"Measure"**.
- The system records the weight automatically.

### **Step 3: Measure Sample + Sieve**
- Add the sample to the sieves and weigh each again.
- Press **"Measure"** for each sieve.

### **Step 4: Analyze & Export Data**
- View calculated statistics (**mean size, D-values, modes**).
- Download **Excel, CSV, or PDF report**.
-Download data and statistics in **Excel / CSV**.

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Scale Not Connecting?**
- Ensure no other program (e.g., **serial monitor**) is using the port.
- Try **reconnecting the USB cable** and restarting the app.
- Modify the **COM port** settings if needed.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weight Not Updating?**
- Ensure the **scale is stable** before measuring.
- Press the **"Measure"** button again to retry.
- Make sure Serial Connection Settings are correct
